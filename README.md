# Hi there / Sawasdee krub / Hola! ✌🏻

My name is Tanat. I am a SRE engineer here at Adevinta living in Barcelona, Spani. My work is to build a platform, and evolve with it.

## Passsion

My passion is to make developer's lives easier. I am happy to see the platform I built helps developer to work easily and of course, fun to work with.


## What's new

- I am learning Golang as a new programming language, as well as Spanish 🇪🇸. (Learning a new human language as a programmer feels a bit odd to me though :p)

- I am taking another deeper step into Kubernetes world  💪🏻 by writing operators, making PRs to kubesigs, etc.
