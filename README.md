# Hi there / Sawasdee krub / Hola! ✌🏻

My name is Tanat. I am a senior SRE engineer here at Adevinta living in Barcelona, Spain. 

I work with production system, Kubernetes and incidents. 

I'm enjoying building a runtime platform at scale!

## Passsion

My passion is to make developer's lives easier. I am happy to see the platform I built helps developer to work easily and of course, fun to work with.

I also love sharing my experience to the wider audience, you can find my talks in p99conf, kubeFM and more!
